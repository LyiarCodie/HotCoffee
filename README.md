## Purpose
🧐 This project was made only for study purposes for a colleague.

## Idea/Inspiration
☕ The inspiration for this project came from a game called **Bonespresso** (which at the time i was developing this project
was still in development).

🎈 **Bonespresso** and **Drahmen** (original game owner) socials:
- [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ADRjBdtCRb)


## How to Play
🚀 To run this project you need **NodeJS 20+**.

Clone the project to your machine or download the source code as a zip.

Open a terminal in the the project folder and run `npm install`

and after all dependencies are installed run `npm run dev`

If all goes well, you should see a message in your terminal with a link to (probably) http://localhost:5173

just open this URL in your browser.

Click in **Start** to begin rendering the game and **Stop** to... well, stop.

Use **W**, **A**, **S** and/or **D** to move.
